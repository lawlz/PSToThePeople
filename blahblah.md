## Overview

The goal of this presentation is to share knowledge about PowerShell that would be valuable for anyone that wants to learn more, no matter what level of PowerShell foo you are at.  The ultimate hope is that everyone walks away with use cases and tools they could use today.  

First I will walk through some tips, tricks and how to's, mainly things I wish I knew when I started using PowerShell.  Then I will go over some automation use cases of where you could save time using PowerShell for incident response or even just to quickly gather AD configuration data.  It is all possible in this shell.

## Outline

1. get-help - we all need it..
2. PS has a .profile?!  And how I use it.
3. Never use ADUC again - Powershell AD Tools and the cool things therein
4. send-malwareMail.ps1 <â€“ IR Automation Use Case
5. You like your C# code that much, lets add-type   <-- Time permitting
